## About the bot

Find Plasma Bot is a discord bot designed to act as a tool that assists the community to help each other in the COVID-19 crysis we are facing today. Compatible donors can share their info and thus help out patients who are in dire need of blood plasma for recovering from the fatal disease. Recipients can add requests and automatically get the information of compatible donors from the server.
